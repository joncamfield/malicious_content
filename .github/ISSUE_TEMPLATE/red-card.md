Please submit card ideas for "Red Cards" that fill in the blanks of the blue cards.  Card text should be in the grammatical format of a "noun phrase" (some examples here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_phrase). An easy rule of thumb is that it should "fit" in these sample phrases (and/or work with current Blue Card text:

Please make one suggestion per issue.
